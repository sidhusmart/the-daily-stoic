This repository contains the code for a simple Chrome extension that shows up the stoic for that day when you open a new tab. I think this was a nice way for me to actually follow the book and start the day with a bit of reflection and understanding.

This is Work In Progress and I'm also using this as a way to learn Javascript (together with ChatGPT) in a calm, methodical fashion.

This extension does not collect any user data. It only shows a stoic quote when you open a new tab and provides you with some additional context for reflecting on it.
