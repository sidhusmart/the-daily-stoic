    "# Extracting Stoic Quotes from \"The Daily Stoic\" Using LLMs and OpenAI Batch API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a robust workflow for extracting structured data specifically, the date, quote, author, and reflection from each page of \"The Daily Stoic\" PDF. Instead of relying on traditional PDF parsing or OCR heuristics, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for their superior understanding of document layout and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "- Converting each PDF page to an image.\n",
    "- Crafting a prompt with a one - shot example to guide the LLM in extracting the required fields.\n",
    "- Using the OpenAI API (including the Batch API for cost efficiency) to process all pages in parallel.\n",
    "- Handling large input files by splitting them to meet API constraints.\n",
    "- Aggregating and cleaning the results into a single, unified JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables accurate, scalable extraction of daily stoic quotes and reflections, with minimal manual intervention and high reliability."

    "**Objective**: Make use of an LLM to extract the date, quote, author, reflection from each page of the PDF using an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: We can use PDF reader libraries but it might be harder for them to understand the layout and distinction between the 4 distinct elements given that they typically access the text directly. It might mean adding some weird heuristics or regex patterns to enable this flow. Hence LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: Single PDF Page -> Image -> LLM -> structured output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**: Additionally, we will try to use the OpenAI Batch API just to test it and compare cost savings (if any). The methodology to do it is different so might as well give it a shot!"
